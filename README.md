This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function with a combination of percentages and viewport units. The issue stems from the order of operations and how the browser interprets these units in different contexts.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a solution to achieve the expected layout behavior across various screen sizes.
