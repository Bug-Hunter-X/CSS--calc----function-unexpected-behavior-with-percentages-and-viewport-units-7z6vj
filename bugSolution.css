Instead of directly subtracting viewport units from percentages, consider using a more robust approach, such as using media queries or JavaScript to adjust the width based on the viewport size.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .element {
    width: calc(50% - 50px);
  }
}

@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .element {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```
This method provides better control and adaptability across various screen resolutions, mitigating the inconsistencies associated with the `calc()` function's interpretation of percentages and viewport units.
